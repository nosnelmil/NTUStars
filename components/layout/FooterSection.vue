                Hi everyone üëã
              </p>
              <p>
                First of all, I want to sincerely apologize for the lack of updates on <strong>NTU Stars</strong> over the past few years.
                Like many of you, I was juggling a full academic workload while also focusing on landing an internship and securing a job ‚Äî
                and unfortunately, that meant I couldn't give NTU Stars the attention it deserved.
              </p>
              <p>
                But now, I'm happy to share that I'm finally in a more stable place, and I'm ready to recommit to this project that so many
                of you have found useful. üôå
              </p>

              <p>üó≥Ô∏è Want to Help Decide What Comes Next?</p>
              <p>
                Got ideas for what NTU Stars should have next? As a member, you'll get to vote in polls and help shape the future of the platform ‚Äî
                from new features to design improvements, your input matters.
